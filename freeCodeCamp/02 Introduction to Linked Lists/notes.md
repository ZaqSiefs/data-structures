# Linked List

### Node

One node, two parts: one for data and one for a pointer to the memory address of the node in the list.

the final node in the list has 0(invalid) as the memory address.

### time

cannot access elements in constant time.  so, 

Select = O(n)
Insertion = O(n)
Deletion = O(n)


Allows the edit of a list whenever desired, never needing to copy over all the data as it grows.
